# Welcome to Git and GitHub at ChaiCode CohortðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome aboard! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using Git and GitHub at **ChaiCode Cohort**. As a collaborative development platform, Git helps us maintain code quality, track changes, and work together efficiently.

## Basics of Git and GitHub

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system that helps us track changes in our codebase. Think of it as a time machine for your code that allows you to:

- Track all changes made to your code
- Collaborate with team members without conflicts
- Maintain different versions of your project
- Recover from mistakes easily

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud-based** platform that provides a centralized location to store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories.
